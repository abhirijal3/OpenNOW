# Video

## Overview

Both clients decode HEVC or H.264 on Windows with D3D11 and present with a tearing-allowed flip swapchain. Official GFN on this machine ran 10-bit HEVC at 2560×1440@120 for about 76 minutes. OpenNOW's native CloudMatch path requests the saved color depth/chroma and validates it against local decode before the seat is created.

Recovery is the other split. Official GFN NACKs, then flushes a stalled decode queue, then sends IDR, then invalidates references and can freeze the display on a bad ref. OpenNOW NACKs, then sends RTCP PLI plus control `0x302`. It has no reference-invalidation command.

If you stream on OpenNOW today, you get the official two-socket video path with a narrower color SKU and a simpler recovery ladder.

## Key concepts

**Mjolnir.** The dedicated UDP socket that carries video SRTP. Official and OpenNOW both prefer client port 49005. Video does not ride the ICE bundle. ANNOUNCE sets `rtcVideoOnNativeBundle:0`.

**GS extension `0x4753`.** Each video RTP packet carries a 16-byte GameStream header with SOF, EOF, frame index, and FEC coordinates. OpenNOW parses this in `NvstVideoReceiver` (`nvst.rs`).

**ANNOUNCE vs `MediaStreamConfig`.** CloudMatch and RTSP tell the server what to encode. `media_stream_config` tells the local decoder what to expect. Those two defaults disagree in OpenNOW. ANNOUNCE uses 75 Mbps when `maxBitrateMbps` is missing. Decode config uses 10 Mbps.

**Class-preserving fallback.** After a fatal D3D device loss, H.264 can leave Media Foundation for bundled OpenH264 plus SDL. HEVC and AV1 stay on Media Foundation and switch to a software MFT.

## How settings reach the stream

The user changes `resolution`, `fps`, `codec`, `maxBitrateMbps`, and `colorQuality` in Qt. Those values land in `%APPDATA%/OpenNOW/settings.json`. Launch does not resend the profile. `session.create` re-reads the store.

`cloudmatch.rs` `build_create_body` maps the store onto NVIDIA `sessionRequestData`,
field-for-field with the official client's request builder: monitor geometry plus
`requestedStreamingFeatures` with `reflex`, `bitDepth`, `cloudGsync`, `enabledL4S`,
`mouseMovementFlags`, `trueHdr`, `supportedHidDevices`, `profile`,
`fallbackToLogicalResolution`, `hidDevices`, `chromaFormat`, and the
prefilter/HUD tunables. Color follows the saved preference constrained by codec
(H.264 stays 8-bit 4:2:0, AV1 stays 4:2:0); `trueHdr` is set only for a validated
HDR request. Codec, bitrate ceiling, vsync, channel count, QoS policy, touch
support, and the dynamic quality policy are omitted from the feature bag: the
official client resolves the codec locally and carries bitrate/policy purely in
the RTSP ANNOUNCE (`x-nv-vqos` and `MediaStreamConfig`).

Desktop AUTO FPS writes `0`. Core resolves the request through `frame_rate::request_frame_rate`: a missing `fps` defaults to 60 and any present value clamps to the 30–360 request range, so the stored AUTO `0` clamps to 30. Resolution then caps that at 360 for 1920x1080 and 1920x1200 and 240 elsewhere, and rates above 240 additionally need an entitlement at least that high plus a confirmed hardware decoder for the selected codec, otherwise they fall back to the entitlement capped at 240, or to 240 when no entitlement is reported.

`OPENNOW_NATIVE_VIDEO_BACKEND` comes from `nativeVideoBackend` and `decoderPreference`. Auto prefers D3D12 for H.264 and H.265 when the probe succeeds. AV1 auto stays on D3D11 because D3D11-on-12 would flush every frame.

`saveBandwidth` selects the NVIDIA `dynamicStreamingMode` policy announced at RTSP ANNOUNCE time. The official shared settings schema defines `0` off/do-not-adjust, `1` prefer-FPS, `2` prefer-resolution, and `3` on. The official client never sends this policy to CloudMatch — it exists only as the `x-nv-vqos` ANNOUNCE value resolved from live settings — and OpenNOW matches that: `1` (prefer-FPS) when the toggle is on, matching the official Data Saver, Balanced, and Competitive profiles, else `0`. A server-finalized policy in the negotiated profile, when present, still wins over the live setting.

The negotiated value, when the server reports one, is resolved from the session's own feature bag (finalized overrides the requested echo, out-of-range falls back to unreported). Toggling the setting mid-session cannot change the wire policy of the running session; it applies at the next ANNOUNCE.

At the streamer, ANNOUNCE sends `x-nv-vqos[0].dynamicStreamingMode` with that policy and `x-nv-vqos[0].dfc.adjustResAndFps` as the binary enable that follows it (`1` whenever the policy is non-zero). `x-nv-vqos[0].drc.enable` and the `resControl` attributes keep their existing values: `drc` is the separate bitrate axis, and the `resControl` attributes are not emitted by OpenNOW at all, so omitting them inherits the streamer default rather than overriding it.

Midstream adaptation is handled locally: the decoder reports a format change, the Linux session adopts the new format and emits `BackendEvent::FormatChanged`, and `LinuxFrameProducer::ensure_slot` reallocates the Vulkan output image and framebuffer for the new dimensions.

Official persist on this machine (`sharedstorage.json` `customProfile`):

- 2560×1440@120
- `maxBitrate: 100` applied as `maxBitrate: 100000` kbps
- `codec: 0` then runtime HEVC
- `bitDepth: 10`, live chroma 3
- `hdrStreamingMode: "OFF"`
- `vSync: 0`, `reflex: true`, `cloudGsync: false`
- `dynamicStreamingMode: 0`

Official also has named profiles, AI prefilter, HUD sharpness, and upscaling. OpenNOW does not send those on native create.

## How OpenNOW plays video

1. Prefer NVST. Reserve Mjolnir then bundle+1. The child owns RTSPS.
2. ANNOUNCE viewport, fps, bitrate, NACK, FEC 20–35%, packet size 1280 (OpenNOW reduces it for the video route's interface MTU only when that route uses a detected VPN).
3. `NvstVideoReceiver` unprotects SRTP, reorders up to 1024 packets, waits up to 150 ms for a gap, NACKs, assembles access units from the GS header.
4. Keyframe rules. H.264 NAL type 5. H.265 IRAP 16–21. AV1 SOF header byte `[3]==2`.
5. `MediaSink` encoded video queue capacity 2. Overflow marks desync and requests a keyframe. Windows MF overflow uses `push_or_clear_on_overflow`, which dumps the whole reference chain.
6. Media Foundation decode. Hardware MFTs first, then the Microsoft D3D11-aware MFT. NVIDIA and AMD often only expose that Microsoft DXVA2 MFT. `MF_LOW_LATENCY=1`. Output NV12 or P010.
7. Present. Flip-discard, 2 buffers, waitable latency object, max latency 1, `DXGI_PRESENT_ALLOW_TEARING` when available. Not vsync-locked. Letterbox with `fit_rect`.
8. `PresentationClock` ignores GFN RTP timestamps. H.265 and AV1 group timestamps, so the clock learns arrival cadence instead.

Live GFN video is Mjolnir.

Mid-session IPC `bitrate` is rejected. `WindowsBackend::reconfigure_video` has no in-tree caller. Live size changes come from `MF_E_TRANSFORM_STREAM_CHANGE` only.

## How official GFN plays video

From `geronimo.log` and `debug.log` on 2026-08-30:

1. Capability probe. HEVC HDR and YUV444 advertised up to 7680×4320. Rule logged: select HEVC for 240 FPS or higher.
2. `ConfigureStreamerVideoSettings` for this session. 2560×1440, 120 FPS, `maxBitrate: 100000`, HDR off, Reflex on, Cloud G-Sync off, 10-bit, colorSpace 2, chroma 3, codec 0 then HEVC.
3. `Creating DX11 decoder with Async for H265` on a dedicated decode D3D11 device. Present is a second device. Algemist continues with different decode and render devices.
4. `ulNumDecodeSurfaces = 10`. Frame pacing strategy `frl`.
5. First frame. Stream bit depth 10, chroma 3, colorspace 2, limited range, HDR 0. Swapchain 2560×1440, vsync 0, 10-bit, tearing allowed.
6. Two sockets. Video RTP thread on 49005, WebRTC audio bind on 49006, server 5004.
7. NACK wait 52 ms, 1024 packets, 2048 pending, 3 retries, 4 ms backoff. Dynamic FEC on. This session recovered 0 FEC packets and used 639 of 677 NACKed packets.

UI window starts with vsync on. Streaming immediately sets vsync 0 and `DXGI_PRESENT_ALLOW_TEARING`. The session logged 438096 missed vsyncs. That count matches vsync-off present, not 438k stalls.

## Recovery

### Official GFN, this session

1. NACK first. Same envelope OpenNOW advertises.
2. Decode queue overflow, cap 30 then 40. Complete flush, skip remaining frames, `Sent IDR request for stream 0`.
3. QoS drops a P-frame. `Sent invalidation request` for that frame range.
4. Next I-frame clears invalidations. `Stream[0]: recovered`.
5. Client asked the server to freeze display on invalidated reference frames.
6. Session totals. 5 complete flushes, 195 flushed frames, 117 decoder drops. No `PLI` or `FIR` strings. No device-lost path.

Intra-refresh is advertised supported and then `enableIntraRefresh: 0`. Recovery is IDR plus invalidation.

### OpenNOW

| Trigger | What happens |
|---|---|
| RTP gap inside the NACK window | RTCP generic NACK on SCTP `rtcp1`, every 10 ms poll. Max 64 packets, 3 attempts, 20 ms retry, 150 ms track. |
| Unrecoverable gap or bad GS header | Assembler reset. `contiguous=false`. RTCP PLI and NVST control `0x302` IDR. 250 ms cooldown. Inter-frames dropped until a keyframe. That keyframe rebuilds the MFT. |
| Encoded overflow | Clear the reference chain. Request keyframe. |
| Decoder submit or poll error | Rebuild MFT on the same device. If that fails, recreate Graphics plus Decoder for up to 5 s. |
| Device recreate timeout | Fatal. Hardware then falls back, class-preserving for HEVC and AV1. |
| Packet-gap keyframe | Does not spend `NVST_RECOVERY_ATTEMPT_LIMIT`. |
| Other NVST recovery | One `recover()`, then terminal. |

NVST does not send FIR. OpenNOW has no invalidation command and no display-freeze-on-bad-ref.

`reset_decoder` after loss is required. `MFSampleExtension_CleanPoint` alone does not forget damaged H.264 references. See the comment in `platform-windows/src/format.rs`.

## Gotchas

Two bitrate defaults. Missing `maxBitrateMbps` becomes 75 Mbps on the wire and 10 Mbps in the local media config.

Overlay `8-bit` is a label. A P010 decode still presents as BGRA and the HUD still prints 8-bit.

Hardware MFT enum is often empty. The Microsoft D3D11-aware MFT is the real GPU path.

Stats LATENCY, PING, and LOSS% are placeholders. NVST has no trustworthy RTT in this tree. LOSS shows dropped-frame count only.
